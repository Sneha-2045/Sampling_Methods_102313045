# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Sampling Techniques

## Overview

This project explores the impact of different sampling techniques on machine learning models for credit card fraud detection. Since fraud datasets are highly imbalanced, selecting an appropriate sampling strategy is essential for building accurate and reliable models.

---

##  Methodology

* Loaded and analyzed the dataset to understand class imbalance.
* Applied five sampling techniques: **Simple Random, Cross Validation (Stratified K-Fold), Stratified, Cluster, and Bootstrap.**
* Trained multiple models including **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).**
* Compared model performance using accuracy and visualized the results with a bar graph.
